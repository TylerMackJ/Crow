# Crow

CLI for sending Tweets

## Usage
`crow '{TEXT}' -p {PATH TO PICTURE}`

Both the text or the picture are optional.

### First time use
On the first usage, crow will redirect you to a Twitter authorization. Once this has been completed once, authorization keys are stored on a users keyring for future usage.
